How to use the To-Do-List Application:
The application is set up to allow users to add new items to the list, delete items from the list, mark items as completed, and view the to-do list. 
To use the application, follow the prompts and type in the number that corresponds to the action you want to take on the lit.
Type '1' to add to the list
Type '2' to view the list
Type '3' to mark a task as complete
Type '4' to delete an item from the list
Type '5' to quit the program
Items on the list are listed as incomplete unless marked as completed through selection '3' on the menu
If a number other than 1,2,3,4 or 5 is selected by the user, the program returns an error and requests that the user select a number from the menu
